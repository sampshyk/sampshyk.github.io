```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## what does this command do?

This is the second page of my website. 

making a change seems to mean I need to knit the file again. 

I wonder how to make this pretty!
I wonder how long a line of text can take before it moves it to the next line on the displayed webpage. It seems weird to me that it would stretch out the length of it indefinityly but hey, I didn't design this program. I guess we'll see what happens when I load it.

## Captains log: commit 5

Ive shown how to alter the title and the ## command will allow you to create a title. Still havent filled out color. Is it possible to change the color of the text and its font? I will make a new page whose content will include nothing but the full lyrics of the Nickleback song photograph. I'm going to see if I can get the title section of the page without the assistance of the default R settings. 

## Captains log: commit 9 I think

I've decided to use my project to create a website to link useful documents that may be hard to find for other Yu-Gi-Oh judges. Im having some issues creating a new link to it though. As a personal note, if the name of a page is 2 or more words seperated by a space, in the site directory, replace the spaces with underscores.
